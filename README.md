Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass provides a better way for student drivers to study for their theoretical driving exams, and schedule appointments to practice their practical driving tests. DriverPass wanted to create a website that allows customers to create an account, purchase a study package, study and take exams online, and schedule appointments with drivers to practice. Employees of DriverPass also need the ability to purchase packages for customers and schedule their appointments.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt that my diagrams in project 2 were easy to understand and provided a visualization for key concepts of the application.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I could've gone into more depth with my assumptions and limitations on the Business Requirements Document from project 1. I would include a few more limitations and assumptions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I felt that I was able to understand the user's needs via the technical requirements and interview. I created use cases and diagrams to fit these use cases, which allowed me to visualize the user's needs. I then adapted the needs into what would be possible for a website. The users are obviously the ones that use the site the most, so their needs must be at the forefront.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Thinking in terms of functional and non-functional requirements was very helpful for software design. I also felt that creating use case, UML, and Gantt diagrams was very helpful for visualization and giving others a better understanding of what the application should do.
